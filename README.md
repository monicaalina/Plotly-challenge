# Plotly-challenge

In this assignment, it is required to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.



Plotly

* Use the D3 library to read in samples.json
* Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample
* Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information
* Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page
* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected
